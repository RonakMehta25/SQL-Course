Stored Procedure

Stored Procedure is a group of T-SQL statements. If you have a query which is repeating over and over again then you can store it as a stored procedure and call it just by it's name.

SQL is a query language to operate on sets.

It is more or less standardized, and used by almost all relational database management systems: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, Informix, etc.

PL/SQL is a proprietary procedural language used by Oracle

PL/pgSQL is a procedural language used by PostgreSQL

TSQL is a proprietary procedural language used by Microsoft in SQL Server.

Procedural languages are designed to extend SQL's abilities while being able to integrate well with SQL. Several features such as local variables and string/data processing are added. These features make the language Turing-complete.

They are also used to write stored procedures: pieces of code residing on the server to manage complex business rules that are hard or impossible to manage with pure set-based operations.

Eg

CREATE PROCEDURE spGetEmployees
@Gender varchar(5),
@DepartmentId int
As
Begin
	select name,gender,salary from employees where gender=@Gender and departmentId=@DepartmentId
End

spGetEmployees "Male",2

TO execute the stored procedure.
1. We can directly call the name spGetEmployees
2. execute spGetEmployees
