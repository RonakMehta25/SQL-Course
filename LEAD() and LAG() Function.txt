SELECT
    productline, 
    order_year, 
    order_value,
    LAG(order_value, 1) OVER (
        PARTITION BY productLine
        ORDER BY order_year
    ) prev_year_order_value
FROM 
    productline_sales;
	
In the above example , you will get order_value from previous year in current year


Answer for consecutive same numbers

set @rw=1;
select num from (select id,num,case when lg!=num then @rw:=@rw+1 else @rw end as rn from (select id,num, lag(num) over(order by id) as lg from consect) tmp1) tmp2 group by rn having count(*)>=3;
