MySQL Triggers


The MySQL trigger is a database object that is associated with a table. 

It will be activated when a defined action is executed for the table. 

The trigger can be executed when you run one of the following MySQL statements on the table: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE and it can be invoked before or after the event.



The main requirement for running such MySQL Triggers is having MySQL SUPERUSER privileges.

CREATE TRIGGER agecheck BEFORE INSERT ON people FOR EACH ROW IF NEW.age < 0 THEN SET NEW.age = 0; END IF;

The SQL standard defines two types of triggers: row-level triggers and statement-level triggers.

A row-level trigger is activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted.  For example, if a table has 100 rows inserted, updated, or deleted, the trigger is automatically invoked 100 times for the 100 rows affected.


A statement-level trigger is executed once for each transaction regardless of how many rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.

MySQL supports only row-level triggers. It doesnâ€™t support statement-level triggers.
